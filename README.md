# Speed-Cameras-and-Vision-Zero-Project_HUBXC410

Client: Livable Streets Alliance

Objective: The project focuses on assessing the effectiveness of speed cameras within Vision Zero cities. Vision Zero is an initiative aimed at eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries while promoting safe and equitable mobility. Although speed cameras are implemented to reduce crashes, concerns have arisen that they may disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly Black neighborhoods, as seen in Chicago. The project aims to evaluate the impact of speed cameras on crash reduction in five cities with speed cameras (e.g., Seattle, Chicago, NYC) and five cities without speed cameras (e.g., Boston, Houston, LA).

The final deliverable includes a report analyzing the data, with an optional goal to compare these cities with non-Vision Zero cities and provide deeper insights into the demographics affected by camera enforcement.

This project helps address whether speed cameras are an effective long-term solution for crash reduction or merely a stopgap measure that shifts focus away from infrastructure improvementsâ€‹.
